Users of directive usually refer to\n * the directive factory as the directive. For example, \"The repeat directive\".\n *\n * Usually a template author will invoke a directive factory in their template\n * with relevant arguments, which will then return a directive function.\n *\n * Here's an example of using the `repeat()` directive factory that takes an\n * array and a function to render an item:\n *\n * ```js\n * html`<ul><${repeat(items, (item) => html`<li>${item}</li>`)}</ul>`\n * ```\n *\n * When `repeat` is invoked, it returns a directive function that closes over\n * `items` and the template function. When the outer template is rendered, the\n * return directive function is called with the Part for the expression.\n * `repeat` then performs it's custom logic to render multiple items.\n *\n * @param f The directive factory function. Must be a function that returns a\n * function of the signature `(part: Part) => void`.
