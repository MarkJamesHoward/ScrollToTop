# \<scroll-to-top\>

This Web Component scrolls the page to the top upon clicking the toast notification. The notification will display once a certain scroll depth is reached and remain visible from this point onwards. For very long pages this is a quick shorcut to the top of the page rather than having to use the scroll bar which can be cumbersome.

Import using the below syntax:

```
import "scroll-to-top"
```

Then add the element to your page as below:

<scroll-to-top></scroll-top-top>

Use the activatewhen property to determine when the toast notification is shown. This value is in pixels and by default is set to 200. The below

<scroll-to-top activatewhen="400"></scroll-top-top>
